***ABSTRACT***

Symbian OS is mainly a mobile operating system designed for Smartphone devices. Mainly Nokia and Sony Ericson were the main manufacturers of Symbian OS, while other number of mobile phone companies existed that used Symbian OS with the huge initial success of shipping 450 million Smartphones from 2002-2010. Symbian became the most popular platform for the Smartphone devices but failed to maintain its popularity for a long period of time. Soon Android and iOS took the market and from 2007 onwards downfall of Symbian OS was encountered. This paper focuses on what Symbian OS is and its history; its user-friendly features, limitation of Symbian OS, evolution of other OS where downfall of Symbian OS started, and lastly market overcome of other OS over Symbian. This paper is about rise and fall of Symbian OS. This paper was written by web search and past paper analysis.   

***INTRODUCTION***


Symbian OS is a mobile operating system especially used by Nokia Mobile Devices.  Looking at a brief history Symbian originated from EPOC. This operating system was developed in C++ platform and consisted key features such as high performance, multitasking, Multilanguage support, object oriented, optimized memory management, portable etc. Nokia was the main manufacturer of the Symbian phones.  In the early 2000’s Nokia and other mobile companies were at the height of producing Smartphones. At this point near 2007 they were untouchable in the Smartphone market. It was a feature rich Smartphone which had a good market share. But in 2007, Apple released the iPhone, which changed user’s perspective towards the look and feel of Smartphone devices. The Symbian developers introduced many features in the emerging models of the phones but it failed to gain user attraction and popularity. With the increased emergence of Android and iOS, Symbian is almost gone now. Nokia formed a partnership with Microsoft that would see that Nokia uses Windows OS as its primary mobile platform and Symbian will be it franchise platform. This dropped the application support of the Symbian OS.  Research in June 2011 indicated that over 39% of mobile developers using Symbian at the time of publication were planning to abandon the platform.
RESEARCH TOPIC
 How Symbian OS reached its height of success and how its downfall occurred. 

***METHODOLOGY***


The information in this paper were collected from different website such as developers Nokia, Symbian, apple, developers Symbian etc. and journals related to the topic. 
BRIEF HISTORY OF SYMBIAN OS
Symbian OS is an open source mobile operating platform especially used by Nokia Mobile Devices.  Looking at a brief history, Symbian originated from EPOC which was first introduced by Psion Software which was founded by David Potter back in 1991, which then later merged with mobile companies such as Nokia, Sony Ericson and became Symbian Ltd in 1998. In November 2000 world's first Symbian OS phone, the Ericsson R380 Smartphone was launched. It was one of the most popular mobile operating system till 2010 on an average, before it was overtaken by android. The operating systems in these "Smartphone" devices are developed in C++ platform, user interface framework and tools.


***SOME KEY FEATURES OF SYMBIAN OS:***

***USER FRIENDLY FEATURES***


Some key features of Symbian OS includes:  Performance: Minimal demands on batteries and low memory, Multitasking and Multithreading: parallel processing of application, Standards: technology based on agreed-upon standards ensuring features such as robust, portable and inter-operatable. Object oriented: object orientation in device drivers uses a two layer abstraction design, Memory Management: optimized memory management because of lack of virtual memory for embedded software environment, Runtime Memory Requirements: minimized to very small executable size with executable ROM-based code, Security: secure communication and safe data storage, International environment support, Reusable components: rich and varied core designed with API's specialized for multimedia, Active objects: makes the waiting and external events more efficient, Networking: supports TCP/IP networking as well as several other communication inferences such as serial, infrared and Bluetooth and luggable messaging architecture etc. (Symbian OS)

***LIMITATIONS OF SYMBIAN OS***


1.	Poor internet performance
2.	Failure to gain advantage from being open-source
3.	The unsatisfactory app-availability 
4.	Lack of appropriate number of Developers 
5.	User-Interface was boring
6.	Handset operating system mainly mobile phones and PDAs
7.	Presence of four alternative UI systems
8.	Lack of profit generation 
9.	Frequent screen freezes and call drops
10.	Unmanageable networks of Symbian partners

***EVOLUTION OF OTHER OS***


 Android started its journey in 2008 when Google launched Android OS, which took over the marketplace pretty easily. People encountered amazing and new features in Android such as web browser, messaging, voice-based features, multi-touch, multitasking, screen capture, video calling, Multilanguage support, accessibility, connectivity, Bluetooth, external storage etc. (list of features in android).            
Apple launched iOS back in 2007 and consists of these key features i.e. UI Kit, Graphics, Foundation, Audio, Multi Touch Gestures, Electronic Accessories, Quick look, Store Kit, Media Library, iOS simulator, Inter app messaging, Push Notification, Game Kit, Messaging, In-App messaging, Gyro+ Accelerometer, Multitasking, Address Book, Compass, iAd, Newsstand, Core location, Map Kit, Networking etc.  IPhone found immediate success after its release because of the apple consisted the Internet features of PC in handheld devices, which was a great achievement in fact.

MARKET OVERCOME OF OTHER OS OVER SYMBIAN

***WHY DID NOKIA DROP SYMBIAN OS?***


The move of Nokia is adapting the Windows platform over Symbian is viewed in the following ways:
1. Nokia was in a close tie with Microsoft to make windows OS as its primary platform.
2. People accepted Android and iOS as the mainstream mobile operating system. The increased market share acquired by the Samsung Galaxy series of Smartphone and Apple iPhones also caused the Microsoft-Nokia collaboration, which caused the Symbian OS to be dropped as the main mobile OS of choice for Nokia. 
3. Symbian OS was not able to meet the changing needs. With such a stiff competition by the Android and iOS, which took a about a year to bring changes to the OS (provide updates and bug-fixes) Symbian needed 22 or so months to complete it. 
4. Nokia needed another mainstream OS to meet the competition and thus collaboration with Windows to market windows phone was the obvious choice.  

***AT PRESENT*** 


With Symbian OS almost dead, Android and iOS are the mainstream OS at present. Windows is also catching up, with the Nokia Lumia range of Smartphone's but hasn’t been able to gain popularity because of the low application support for the windows OS. Mobile phone OS ecosystem is in chaos right now.  Nokia made a better judgment by dropping the Symbian platform and adapting the Windows OS. The 'Downfall of Symbian' may breath a new life in Nokia to bring it into the Smartphone war. The ups and downs in the Smartphone market has resulted in users being able to choose from a variety of platforms as they find suitable for their needs.


***CONCLUSION***


Hence Symbian OS, though, was a huge success winner at the beginning but made its free fall at the end.   There were different factors responsible for this i.e. lack of up gradation in the features, lack of a good and effective number of programmers, evolution and market overcome of other operating systems and lack of proper plan implementation of mobile phone companies manufacturing the Symbian OS. Hence it can be concluded that Symbian OS is almost extinct now.
